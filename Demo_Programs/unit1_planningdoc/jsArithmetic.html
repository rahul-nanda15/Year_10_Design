Health Score: How healthy is your recipe? Using this calculation, we can compile different nutritional data and statistics into 1 SUMMARIZED number/value (out of 100). It takes into account your daily requirements of protein, energy, and carbohydrates. <br> For example, when: <br> protein = 20 grams <br> energy = 7000 kilojoules <br> carbs = 250 grams <br> the health score would be (out of 100): <!--calculation description -->
